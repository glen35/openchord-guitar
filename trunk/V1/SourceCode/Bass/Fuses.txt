Fuses - on an AVR chip fresh from Atmel, the default fuses won't
work with the V1 firmware, so they need to be changed.

Generally speaking, the fuses should correspond to this -

Brown-out detection at 1.8V
ResetDisable   OFF
DWEN           OFF
SPIEnable      ON
WatchDogOn     OFF
EESave         ON
BootSize       1024 words
BootReset      ON
ClockDiv8      OFF
ClockOut       OFF
Clock Select   Ext. Crystal Oscillator 8.0 - MHz, start up time, anything

Additionally, when programming the bootloader to the chip, it's a good idea
to set the programming lock bits to prevent writing in the boot sector.  This
keeps you from accidentally overwriting the bootloader program should the new
program you're trying to update is too big for the chip. Keep in mind that these
lock-bits get reset on a chip erase, so every time you program via SPI, remember
to reset the lockbits.

Here are some pre-calculated fuse values, in case you're not using AVR Studio
or a similar graphical fuse programmer:

ATmega328p: 
Extended     0xFE
High         0xD2
Low          0xCE

ATmega168, ATmega88:
Extended     0xF8
High         0xD6
Low          0xCE
