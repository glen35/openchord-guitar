	Thanks to the people at Objective Development for their open-source V-USB library
	for the AVR microcontroller. http://www.obdev.at/avrusb/

	Special thanks to Frank Zhao and his Wiimote Extension Library,
	details which can be found here:

	Also, thanks to Hector Martin's work on encryption and decryption

The files included in the code are broken down as such:

configAndConstants.h - This file holds constants and configuration options. 
	This is the file you will most likely have to modify, but it uses simple pre-processor directives to get
	you to where you probably need to be. Adjust this to reflect the system and circuit board you're using.

V1.h/main.c - These files handle the main program flow, as well as the actual reading of the guitar strings.
	These files need to be somewhat further separated, as the mode information is somewhat too closely
	integrated with the code.

processStringState.h/.c - These files control how the program interprets the string presses.
	It currently supports 3 modes, fret, string, and note modes. It probably needs to be refactored to allow for
	additional modes to be added more easily.

xxxxxInterface.h/.c - These functions handle the communication between the guitar and the xxxx device.
	They implement two functions - startCommunication(void) which lets the other hardware start up,
	and sendData(dataForController), which takes in the data in the form of a dataForController struct
	(this struct is held in V1Typedefs.h).

pindef.h - This file, and associated files, holds the numbers of the pins for each chip configuration

stringComboTests.h -  This holds the patterns that the guitar checks against for for different combinations.
	These combinations are the special 'escape chords' that activate mode changes, configuration mode,
	and star power.

buttonStringPatterns.h - This file holds the initial default mappings of fingerings to buttons on the guitar.
	This default mapping can be restored by pressing the "Reset Guitar" escape chord.

guitarInitFunctions.c - This holds startup parameters for the chip that are needed for the guitar.
	It sets up pins and timers to be used by the guitar.
