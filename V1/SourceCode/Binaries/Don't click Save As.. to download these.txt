If you do, you'll save the files as a webpage.  
In order to actually get the binary code, click on the file name
to view it in your browser, then copy all the program text and
paste it into your own file that you name whatever you want .hex,
then upload that to your V1.

Also, a note about the binaries - unfortunately, the circuit boards
have undergone some changes over the life of the product.  Most
importantly, with the May 2010 board revision, the pin mapping changed.
Be sure you know which board you have, so you can download the proper
binary.

Additionally, a few of the very first boards came with a 16mHz crystal,
instead of the current 12mHz crystal.  As of May 2010, we're no longer
compiling binaries for those automatically, in order to reduce confusion.
If you have one of those boards, either e-mail us and we'll compile you
a binary, or we'd be happy to send you a 12mHz crystal you can swap in
your board, free of charge.
